# ProjectSpear
 Welcome, 

 (July 21, 2023): 
 On Day 1 , I'm looking to make a "simple" game from start to finish. 
 I have no idea what it will be or what it will look like. 
 I will use Godot. 
 Maybe, my first step will be looking at the project settings.
 Where will this game be published? Maybe PC, maybe a steam game?
 - Made Godot project and set up some basic settings, created a TitleScene, made an .exe
 - Made a Utils script to close "game" with esc

 Game Ideas:
 - something is about to happen over a certain point like (Missile Command), 
 as in a missile will hit a city if you don't stop it or an astroid
 - Maybe battleships, where we only know if you hit something
 - An astroid shooting game
 - A sniper game 
 - Neopets Game clone? I had a great time with those
 - Baloons like game
 - Peggle 
 - 1v1 online or local game
 - Megaman networks
 - stickman game, maybe spearguy
 - What about a game with objects flying by and you have to jump (by holding down space for longer) 
 - what if you shoot a spear to a platform and you zoom to it (holding for harder throw )
 - what if you can speed jump from one place to the other, where you move to dodge and you spear enemies as you dash through them. 
 it would be a high speed game. Hold to go longer distance, more dmg. Could be an arpg. You have doudge probjectiles and aoe explosions. Auto generate map in all directions. You are in an open world and there are world environments that block your jump. You have a leveling system. You can increase HP, Jump dmg, Jump speed, Jump distance, Jump fire trail, crit chance, exp gained. Nope(You can only jump) you can walk. You can get crowd controlled. You lifesteal. Think a little like shovel night, but spearguy. Controls, Arrows and spacebar. Have light stamina in the game. Maybe a minimap. Have regular monster and elites. Bosses (1 boss to start). Enemy hp bars at the top of the screen. Multi hit enemies? Collision? Touch damage? Holding down goes in block mode(maybe this uses stamina) Enemy and player level. Replay game. Small overall upgrades. Things progress with time. 5 min game. Boss spaws at 5 mins. Maybe get back stamina if you hit enemies. Everything should want to make you go faster. If you aren't strong enough at 5 mins, you lose. World timer at the top. crafting? No inventory. Maybe hiting a enemy spawns health orbs.
 - Games to get inspitation: Hades, Diablo, Shovel Knight, Ori, Zelda
 - Name Ideas: SpearGuy, MightySpear, Spear, SpearType, SpearGirl, SpearMaster, Project Y: Spear, Project Spear
 - Added: Title screen buttons to play and quit, added a world scene, made it a controller game, hidden mouse
