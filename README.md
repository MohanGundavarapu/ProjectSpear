 Hi,

 Welcome, 

 (July 21, 2023)
 On Day 1 , I'm looking to make a "simple" game from start to finish. 
 I have no idea what it will be or what it will look like. 
 I will use Godot. 
 Maybe, my first step will be looking at the project settings.
 Where will this game be published? Maybe PC, maybe a steam game?
 - Made Godot project and set up some basic settings, created a TitleScene, made an .exe
 - Made a Utils script to close "game" with esc
